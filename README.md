In this repository, I have used object oriented programming to create a shopping cart.
The instructions: 
    Create an object class for the product to store the properties for id, name and price of the product.
    Create an object class for the shopping cart item to store the properties for product and its quantity.
    To the preceding object class, add the method to calculate the total price of the item.
    Create another object class for the shopping cart which contains an array of ShoppingCartItem instances. 
    To the shopping cart object, add the following methods.
        Add the methods to: 
        Get the total of items inside the cart
        Add items
        Remove items
        Display cart items
